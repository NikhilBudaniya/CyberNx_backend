"# CyberNx_backend" 
I have taken help of djoser documentation and official django and django rest framework.

In the I have made no such assumptions, the authorization in my app is token based authorization.
using localhost:8000/api/users -> It will show list of all users and only logged in users will be able to access it.
You can get authorization token by localhost:8000/api/token/login
